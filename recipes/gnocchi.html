		<h3>Italian pasta that is small, soft, and made from a combination of potatoes, flour, and eggs.</h3>
		<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Potatoes</li>
			<li>Flour</li>
			<li>Egg</li>
    			<li>Salt</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Steps:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Cook the potatoes: Peel the potatoes and cut them into small pieces. Boil the potatoes in a pot of salted water until they are soft and tender. Drain the potatoes and let them cool slightly.</li>
			<li>Mash the potatoes: Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, mash them in a bowl until they are smooth and there are no lumps.</li>
			<li>Add flour and egg: Add flour, egg, and a pinch of salt to the mashed potatoes. Mix until the dough comes together and forms a ball.</li>
			<li> Roll out the dough: Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour. Divide the dough into small pieces and roll each piece into a long rope.</li>
			<li>Cut the gnocchi: Use a knife to cut the ropes of dough into small pieces, about 1 inch in length.</li>
			<li>Shape the gnocchi: To give the gnocchi its distinctive shape, use a fork to press down on each piece of dough, making ridges on one side and a small indentation on the other.</li>
			<li>Cook the gnocchi: Boil a pot of salted water and carefully add the gnocchi to the water. Cook for about 2-3 minutes or until the gnocchi floats to the surface.</li>
			<li>Serve the gnocchi: Remove the cooked gnocchi from the pot using a slotted spoon and serve with your favorite sauce or toppings. Enjoy!</li>
